## Technical Architecture Document: project-build-a-modern

**1. System Overview:**

`project-build-a-modern` is a modern e-commerce platform built using a microservices-ready architecture.  The system is designed for scalability, maintainability, and security, employing a layered approach separating concerns between the frontend (React), backend (FastAPI), and database (initially SQLite, scalable to PostgreSQL).  We prioritize a clean architecture with clear separation of concerns, utilizing dependency injection and a robust testing strategy.  The system will incorporate CI/CD for continuous integration and deployment, ensuring rapid iteration and reliable releases.  Our design emphasizes modularity, allowing for independent scaling of individual components as needed.

**Design Principles:**

* **Modular Design:**  The application is designed as a collection of loosely coupled, independently deployable services.
* **Separation of Concerns:**  Clear separation between presentation, business logic, and data access layers.
* **Scalability:** Horizontal scaling through containerization and load balancing.
* **Maintainability:** Clean code, consistent coding style, comprehensive documentation.
* **Security:** Secure authentication, authorization, and data protection mechanisms.

**3. Technology Stack:**

* **Backend:** FastAPI (Python 3.11), Uvicorn (ASGI server)
* **Frontend:** React with TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
* **Database:** PostgreSQL (Initially SQLite for development, PostgreSQL for production – easier scaling and ACID properties)
* **ORM:** SQLAlchemy
* **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
* **Payment Gateway:** Stripe API
* **Search:** Elasticsearch (for scalability beyond simple database search)
* **Caching:** Redis (for product catalog, user data, etc.)
* **Containerization:** Docker, Docker Compose, Kubernetes (for production deployment)
* **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions (or similar)
* **Monitoring:** Prometheus, Grafana


**4. Database Design:**

We'll use a relational database (PostgreSQL) with the following key entities:

* **Users:** `id`, `username`, `email`, `password_hash`, `address`, etc.
* **Products:** `id`, `name`, `description`, `price`, `inventory`, `category`, `images`, etc.
* **Categories:** `id`, `name`, `description`
* **Orders:** `id`, `user_id`, `order_date`, `total_amount`, `status`
* **OrderItems:** `id`, `order_id`, `product_id`, `quantity`, `price`
* **Reviews:** `id`, `user_id`, `product_id`, `rating`, `comment`
* **Carts:** `id`, `user_id`, `items` (JSONB for flexibility)


**Data Modeling Approach:**  We will utilize a normalized relational model to ensure data integrity and efficiency.  Relationships will be defined using foreign keys.

**Migration Strategy:**  SQLAlchemy migrations will be used for managing database schema changes.


**5. API Design:**

RESTful API principles will be followed. Endpoints will be organized logically by resource (e.g., `/users`, `/products`, `/orders`).  Authentication will be handled using JWTs.  Standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) will be used.  Responses will be standardized using Pydantic schemas for data validation and consistency.


**6. Security Architecture:**

* **Authentication:** JWT-based authentication with secure token generation and validation.  Password hashing using bcrypt or similar strong algorithm.
* **Authorization:** Role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to sensitive resources.
* **Data Protection:**  HTTPS for secure communication, input validation to prevent injection attacks, parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection, and data encryption at rest and in transit.
* **Security Best Practices:** Regular security audits, penetration testing, and adherence to OWASP guidelines.


**7. Frontend Architecture:**

* **Component Organization:**  Component-based architecture using React functional components.
* **State Management:** Redux Toolkit or Zustand for managing application state.
* **Routing:** React Router for client-side routing.
* **API Integration:**  Fetch API or Axios for making API requests.


**8. Integration Points:**

* **Stripe API:**  For payment processing.
* **Email Service (e.g., SendGrid, Mailgun):** For order updates and other notifications.
* **Elasticsearch:** For product search.
* **Data Exchange Formats:** JSON for API communication.
* **Error Handling:**  Centralized error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes.


**9. Development Workflow:**

* **Local Development Setup:**  Docker Compose for setting up a local development environment.
* **Testing Strategy:**  Unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests using pytest and Selenium/Cypress.
* **Build and Deployment Process:**  Automated CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions or similar, deploying to a Kubernetes cluster.
* **Environment Management:**  Docker containers and environment variables for managing different environments (development, staging, production).


**10. Scalability Considerations:**

* **Performance Optimization:**  Database query optimization, caching strategies (Redis), efficient data structures.
* **Caching Strategies:**  Redis caching for frequently accessed data (product catalog, user data).
* **Load Balancing:**  Load balancer (e.g., Nginx, HAProxy) in front of multiple FastAPI instances.
* **Database Scaling:**  PostgreSQL with read replicas for improved performance.  Consider database sharding for extreme scalability.


**Timeline & Resource Requirements:**

This project requires a phased approach.  The MVP (minimum viable product) focusing on core e-commerce functionality (user authentication, product catalog, shopping cart, checkout, order management) can be delivered within 3-4 months with a team of 4-5 experienced developers (frontend, backend, database).  Subsequent phases will incorporate advanced features (reviews, search, admin dashboard) and scalability enhancements.  The total project timeline is estimated at 6-9 months, depending on resource allocation and feature prioritization.


**Risk Assessment & Mitigation:**

* **Risk:** Database scalability limitations.
* **Mitigation:**  Migrate to PostgreSQL early, implement caching, consider database sharding as needed.

* **Risk:** Security vulnerabilities.
* **Mitigation:**  Regular security audits, penetration testing, and adherence to security best practices.

* **Risk:** Integration issues with third-party services.
* **Mitigation:**  Thorough testing of integrations, robust error handling, and fallback mechanisms.


This document provides a high-level architectural blueprint.  Detailed design specifications will be developed during subsequent phases of the project.  Continuous monitoring and feedback will be crucial for adapting the architecture to evolving business needs and technological advancements.
