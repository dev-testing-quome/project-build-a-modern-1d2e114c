* A Stripe account (for payment processing)


## Installation

### Local Development

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd project-build-a-modern
   ```

2. **Backend setup:**

   ```bash
   cd backend
   python -m venv .venv  # Using .venv for better compatibility
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Frontend setup:**

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the application:**

   * **Backend (from `backend` directory):**

     ```bash
     uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
     ```

   * **Frontend (from `frontend` directory):**

     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```

### Docker Setup

1.  Navigate to the project root directory.
2.  Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed.
3.  Run:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

This will build and start both the frontend and backend containers.  The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` (frontend) and API docs at `http://localhost:8000/docs` and `http://localhost:8000/redoc`.


## API Documentation

Once the application is running, the interactive API documentation is available at:

* **Swagger UI:** http://localhost:8000/docs
* **ReDoc:** http://localhost:8000/redoc


## Usage

**Key Endpoints (Examples):**

* `/products`: GET request to retrieve a list of products.
* `/products/{product_id}`: GET request to retrieve a specific product by ID.
* `/cart`: GET request to view the shopping cart; POST request to add an item to the cart.
* `/checkout`: POST request to initiate the checkout process.
* `/orders`: GET request to view order history (requires authentication).

**Sample Request (GET /products):**

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/products
```

**Sample Response (GET /products):**

```json
[
  {"id": 1, "name": "Product 1", "price": 19.99, ...},
  {"id": 2, "name": "Product 2", "price": 29.99, ...}
]
```

**Common Workflows:**  Detailed workflows are available in the application's documentation within the codebase.
