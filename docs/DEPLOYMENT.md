# Deployment Guide - project-build-a-modern

This guide outlines the deployment process for "project-build-a-modern," a modern e-commerce platform.  We'll focus on a Dockerized deployment strategy, adaptable to various cloud providers.

## Prerequisites

**Required software and tools:**

* Docker:  `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install docker.io` (Debian/Ubuntu) or equivalent for your OS.
* Docker Compose: `sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.15.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose && sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose` (replace with latest version if needed).
* Git:  For source code retrieval.
* A Cloud Provider Account (AWS, GCP, Azure - choose one).  This guide will provide general guidance, specific commands will vary.
* (Optional) Kubernetes or Docker Swarm client tools, depending on your chosen orchestration.

**System requirements:**

* A server with sufficient resources (CPU, RAM, storage) to handle the expected load.  Minimum specifications will depend on anticipated traffic.  Start with a reasonable baseline and scale as needed.
* A stable internet connection.

**Account setup:**

* Create accounts with your chosen cloud provider (AWS, GCP, Azure).
* Create a project/resource group within your cloud provider account.
* Set up appropriate billing and access controls.


## Environment Setup

**Environment variables configuration:**

Create a `.env` file in your project's root directory.  Example:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@db-host:5432/database_name
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_YOUR_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_YOUR_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.example.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=your_email@example.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_email_password
APP_URL=https://your-app-url.com  #Important for email links and redirects
```

**Database setup:**

* Install PostgreSQL (or your chosen database) on your server or cloud instance.  Cloud providers usually offer managed database services.
* Create the database and user as specified in your `.env` file.

**External service configuration:**

* Create a Stripe account and obtain your secret and publishable keys.
* Configure your email provider settings (SMTP).


## Docker Deployment

**Building the Docker image:**

Navigate to your project's root directory and run:

```bash
docker-compose build
```

**Running with docker-compose:**

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This command builds and starts all containers defined in your `docker-compose.yml` file.  Ensure your `docker-compose.yml` includes environment variable loading (e.g., using `.env` file). Example:

```yaml
version: "3.9"
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8000:8000" #Example port mapping
    environment:
      - DATABASE_URL
      - STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
      - ... #other env vars
    depends_on:
      - db
  db:
    image: postgres:14
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=user
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password
      - POSTGRES_DB=database_name
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
```

**Environment configuration:**

Docker Compose automatically loads environment variables from the `.env` file.  Ensure the necessary variables are set correctly.

**Health checks and monitoring:**

Include health check commands in your `docker-compose.yml` to monitor the health of your containers.  Example:

```yaml
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8000/health"]
  interval: 30s
  timeout: 10s
  retries: 3
```

## Production Deployment

**Cloud deployment options:**

* **AWS:** Use AWS Elastic Beanstalk, ECS, or EKS.
* **GCP:** Use Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), Cloud Run, or App Engine.
* **Azure:** Use Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Azure App Service, or Azure Container Instances.

**Container orchestration:**

* **Kubernetes (recommended for scalability):** Deploy your Docker image to a Kubernetes cluster.  Use kubectl commands to manage deployments, services, and ingress.
* **Docker Swarm:**  A simpler option for smaller deployments.

**Load balancing and scaling:**

Your chosen cloud provider offers managed load balancing services.  Configure a load balancer to distribute traffic across multiple instances of your application.  Scale horizontally by adding more containers/pods as needed.

**SSL/TLS configuration:**

Obtain an SSL certificate (Let's Encrypt is a free option) and configure your load balancer or web server to use it.


## Database Setup

**Database migration commands:**

Use a migration tool (e.g., Alembic for Python) to manage database schema changes.  Run migrations before deploying to production.  Example (Alembic):

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

**Initial data setup:**

Populate your database with initial data using scripts or fixtures.

**Backup and recovery procedures:**

Implement regular database backups. Cloud providers offer managed backup solutions.  Establish a recovery plan to restore from backups in case of failure.


## Monitoring & Logging

**Application monitoring setup:**

Use a monitoring tool (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to track application metrics (CPU, memory, request latency).

**Log aggregation:**

Use a centralized logging system (e.g., Elasticsearch, Fluentd, Kibana â€“ the ELK stack) to collect and analyze logs from all containers.

**Performance monitoring:**

Monitor response times, error rates, and other performance indicators.  Use profiling tools to identify bottlenecks.

**Error tracking:**

Use an error tracking service (e.g., Sentry, Rollbar) to capture and analyze application errors.


## Troubleshooting

**Common deployment issues:**

* **Connection errors:** Verify database connectivity, network configurations, and environment variables.
* **Startup failures:** Check application logs for errors.
* **Deployment failures:** Review deployment logs and container status.

**Debug commands:**

* `docker logs <container_name>`: View container logs.
* `docker exec -it <container_name> bash`: Access a running container's shell.
* `docker-compose ps`: Show the status of your containers.

**Log locations:**

Log locations vary depending on your application and logging configuration.  Check your application's configuration files for log paths.

**Recovery procedures:**

* Roll back to a previous deployment version.
* Restore from database backups.
* Restart containers.


## Security Considerations

**Environment variable security:**

Do not hardcode sensitive information (API keys, passwords) in your code.  Use environment variables and secure ways to manage them (e.g., secrets management services offered by cloud providers).

**Network security:**

Use firewalls to restrict access to your application and database.  Implement proper network segmentation.

**Authentication setup:**

Use strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth 2.0, JWT) to protect user accounts.

**Regular security updates:**

Keep your application, dependencies, and operating system up-to-date with security patches.  Regularly scan for vulnerabilities.


This guide provides a foundational framework.  Specific commands and configurations will depend on your application's architecture, chosen technologies, and cloud provider.  Remember to adapt this guide to your specific needs and always prioritize security best practices.
